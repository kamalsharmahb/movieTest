# Movie Genere Sample Test

## Overview

Your company is building an API using Microservices architecture and Docker deployment for a new application that will compete with Netflix. You were hired to build two services (Genres and Movies) using Node.js and your preferred database engine. Only the basic actions (index, show, insert, and delete) is required. The minimal fields for Genres are name and description. For Movies, the minimal fields are name, description, release date, Genre(s), duration and rating.

Please design and develop a solution for this requirement, create the unit tests required and upload the result code to a free Heroku environment. 

The expected deliverable should include the final code and unit tests in a repository and the API in a Heroku environment using Docker.
